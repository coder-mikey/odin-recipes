      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        This recipe stood out to me while browsing for the <em>perfect</em> Strawberry Rhubarb Pie. Patiently waiting for me to click on it in the corner and show me something even better than pie. It was the best first recipe I will be listing and I can feel my mouth watering just typing this. Below is the recipe for this amazing looking delight. I hope you all enjoy it as much as I do.

      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1<sup>1/2</sup> cups of all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3/4 cup of salted butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of packed light brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/3 cup of granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1<sup>1/2</sup> cups of old-fashioned rolled oats</li>
        <li>2 cups of chopped strawberries</li>
        <li>3/4 cup of chopped walnuts</li>
        <li>1<sup>1/2</sup> cups of 1/2-inch sized chopped rhubarb</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of lemon juice</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons of pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of cornstarch</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon of salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon of baking soda</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Steps</h3>
        <h4>Crumb layer</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Preheat oven to 350°F. Prepare a square 9×9" baking dish by lining it with parchment paper so that the bars will be easy to remove and cut once they have cooked and cooled.</li>
          <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the flour, oats, soda, salt, sugars and walnuts, if using. Add to the melted butter and vanilla to the oat mixture and stir to incorporate. When the crumb mixture is evenly moist, press 2/3 of it into the bottom of your prepared baking dish. Set aside the remaining ⅓ of the crumb mixture for the top layer.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Filling</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>In a separate mixing bowl, combine the chopped strawberries and rhubarb. Toss with the lemon juice, then add the sugar and cornstarch and stir to coat the fruit. Spread the strawberry rhubarb mixture evenly over the the bottom crumb layer, then sprinkle with the remaining ⅓ crumb mixture. Bake in the preheated oven for 45-50 minutes, until the top is golden brown and the filling is bubbling.</li>
          <li>Remove from oven and allow to cool completely before cutting into bars.</li>
        </ol>
