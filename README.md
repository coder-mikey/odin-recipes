V-1.0 notes:

This project was an exercise in creating html pages, creating links, and organizing items with both ordered and unordered lists.

While creating this initial project, I was at first intimidated with where to begin writing content but after getting over the hesitation I found the fun and ran into the first hurdle: There's  a lot to type. After a while it was easier and became more of a pattern to create a page with a template, fill in the content, and I got faster in the end as remembering the syntax came quicker.
