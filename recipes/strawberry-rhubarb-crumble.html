      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        This recipe stood out to me while browsing for the <em>perfect</em> Strawberry Rhubarb Pie. Patiently waiting for me to click on it in the corner and show me something even better than pie. It was the best first recipe I will be listing and I can feel my mouth watering just typing this. Below is the recipe for this amazing looking delight. I hope you all enjoy it as much as I do.
