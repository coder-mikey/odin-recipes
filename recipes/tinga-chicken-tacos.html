    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      Tacos are probably my favorite food. Specifically chicken tacos. Especially <strong></strong><em>spicy</em> chicken tacos</strong>. It's no exaggeration to say I can eat them all day. I've done it before and I'll do it again. Down below I've included a fantastic recipe to make a good portion of tacos that could keep you and some people you know pretty happy at dinner time.
