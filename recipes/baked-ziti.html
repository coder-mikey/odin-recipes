    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I love cheese, the more the merrier, for me that is. Baked ziti is the perfect way to load up a bunch of cheese and also leave me with enough food to have for a few days. Below is the recipe I found for a great meatless ziti with rich sauce and all the cheese you can ask for.</p>
