      <h2>Summary</h2>

      <p>I love cheese, the more the merrier, for me that is. Baked ziti is the perfect way to load up a bunch of cheese and also leave me with enough food to have for a few days. Below is the recipe I found for a great meatless ziti with rich sauce and all the cheese you can ask for.</p>
  
      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1 6oz yellow onion</li>
        <li>3 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>1<sup>1/2</sup> ounces of Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of olive oil</li>
        <li><sup>1/2</sup> teaspoon of red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>5 cups of marinara sauce</li>
